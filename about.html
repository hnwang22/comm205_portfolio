			I was born in Beijing, China, where I grew up before immigrating to the United States (more 
			specifically, Texas). I was raised not far from Tsinghua University, where my grandfather
			taught as a professor (and where my father obtained his engineering degree). 
			<br><br>
			After moving to Texas, my family moved around for a bit, before I graduated high school and
			decided to attend Texas A&M University for Electrical Engineering (I would later switch
			to Computer Engineering).

                Alongside coming to A&M for Electrical Engineering, I also made the decision to join the Aggie 
                Corps of Cadets. One of the traditions of the Corps is to give freshman (or "fish" as they are 
                called), a "fish cut", which involves 5-finger whitewalls on the sides with very little on top. 
                Pictured below is me getting my fish cut (the senior in the back is Washington Le, the XO of my outfit).
